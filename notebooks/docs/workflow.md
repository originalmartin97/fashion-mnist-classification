1. IMPORT TOOLS
   ↓ (Get PyTorch, data tools, plotting)
   
2. GET THE DATA
   ↓ (Download Fashion-MNIST, apply normalization)
   
3. CHECK THE DATA (EDA)
   ↓ (Visualize samples, understand what you're working with)
   
4. DEFINE THE MODEL
   ↓ (Create neural network architecture: layers, activations)
   
5. SETUP TRAINING
   ↓ (Choose loss function, optimizer, learning rate)
   
6. TRAIN THE MODEL
   ↓ (Loop: forward pass → calculate loss → backward pass → update weights)
   
7. EVALUATE
   ↓ (Test on unseen data, measure accuracy)
   
8. VISUALIZE RESULTS
   ↓ (Plot loss/accuracy curves, analyze performance)
